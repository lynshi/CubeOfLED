# What does this do?
Code for controlling a 4x4x4 RGB LED cube using an Arduino.  Functions used to set up the Arduino and light LEDs (e.g. cube() and the functions it contains) are thanks to cgrossde's RGB-Led-Cube which can be found at https://github.com/cgrossde/RGB-Led-Cube. All other functions are our own.
